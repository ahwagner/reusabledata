    The licensing is further complicated by the "...version 2 of the License, or (at
    your option) any later version" statement, which means that two direct derivatives of this data could
    possibly end up incompatible: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#AllCompatibility .

    While the application of GNU licenses may make sense for software, they are troublesome to reason about
    for data. For example, how does "[t]he modified work must itself be a software library" work with data? Overall,
    most of the terms of the LGPLv2.0 seem to be nonsensical for data, making applying the terms difficult. However,
    we currently have no further criteria to capture these issues.
